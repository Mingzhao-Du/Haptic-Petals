### Labs

This week, we initially set up a visual framework for a particle diffusion effect, but we have not yet connected the audio files, so the image only shows a regular cycle of diffusion and contraction. We believe that this meets our visual effect requirements, so we will continue to use this visual framework as the main visual solution for our project.

The model used in this demonstration was generated through 3D scanning of a real flower, followed by point cloud processing. Currently, this is the only model we have completed.

A combination of 'Noise' + 'Threshold' + 'Multiply' + 'Over' is used to generate localised distortions and simulate a “petal rupture” effect. Random displacement is masked and amplified to create a dynamic, fragmented appearance.

### Peer Support

As part of this week’s project development, my teammate and I focused on refining the processing workflow of our floral models. All models were generated through 3D scanning of real flowers, allowing us to capture the intricate structures and organic qualities of natural specimens for integration into Haptic Petals.

We plan to process six distinct flower types, selected to represent a range of natural morphological forms. While each scan is visually unique, all models will follow a unified system of dynamic behaviors—including vibration frequency, deformation amplitude, and reassembly patterns. This consistent interaction logic ensures manageable complexity in programming while maintaining aesthetic diversity. In the next stage, we will apply targeted visual enhancements such as color grading and particle refinement to reinforce conceptual coherence and immersive quality within the installation.

### Project Development

The following is a visual preview of our project's interaction logic:

It is important to note that this interaction logic represents an ideal framework. Minor adjustments may be made during the development process due to technical constraints or to accommodate user experience and behavioural responses better.
