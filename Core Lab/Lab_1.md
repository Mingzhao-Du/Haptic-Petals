### Labs

This week, we initially set up a visual framework for a particle diffusion effect, but we have not yet connected the audio files, so the image only shows a regular cycle of diffusion and contraction. We believe that this meets our visual effect requirements, so we will continue to use this visual framework as the main visual solution for our project.

The model used in this demonstration was generated through 3D scanning of a real flower, followed by point cloud processing. Currently, this is the only model we have completed.

A combination of 'Noise' + 'Threshold' + 'Multiply' + 'Over' is used to generate localised distortions and simulate a “petal rupture” effect. Random displacement is masked and amplified to create a dynamic, fragmented appearance.

### Reading & Reflections

*Jacquelyn Ford Morie – Performing in (Virtual) Spaces*: This article focuses on the themes of embodiment and being in virtual spaces. It prompted me to realise that our project, Haptic Petals, should not only allow the audience to “interact,” but also actively evoke their awareness of presence through the interactive process, so that the body is not merely a control interface, but an integral component of the media experience. Within the fragmentation and reconstruction of the flower, the viewer’s gestures should function not simply as triggers but as embodied expressions of emotion. Moreover, participants’ behavioural trajectories ought to be visually acknowledged or “remembered” by the system, creating a sense of being sensed in return. This reflection also led me to consider how we might structure new perceptual relationships through the interplay or tension between visual and auditory rhythms, allowing participants not only to observe transformation but also to feel the synchronisation between natural cycles and internal affective states.

*Kilteni, Groten & Slater – The Sense of Embodiment in Virtual Reality*: This article offers a highly insightful theoretical framework by deconstructing the “sense of embodiment” into three distinct components: self-location, agency, and body ownership. The authors argue that these dimensions can be independently induced and measured, each governed by distinct generative mechanisms, thereby challenging the conventional notion of immersion as a monolithic illusion. Particularly noteworthy is their proposition that embodiment should be understood as a continuous variable rather than a binary state. This reframing not only allows for a more precise interpretation of experiential variation in VR but also provides robust theoretical and methodological foundations for the design of immersive systems. Overall, the article demonstrates a high degree of rigour both in theoretical articulation and practical applicability, offering a strong foundation for future research in embodied media and VR development.

### Peer Support

As part of this week’s project development, my teammate and I focused on refining the processing workflow of our floral models. All models were generated through 3D scanning of real flowers, allowing us to capture the intricate structures and organic qualities of natural specimens for integration into Haptic Petals.

We plan to process six distinct flower types, selected to represent a range of natural morphological forms. While each scan is visually unique, all models will follow a unified system of dynamic behaviors—including vibration frequency, deformation amplitude, and reassembly patterns. This consistent interaction logic ensures manageable complexity in programming while maintaining aesthetic diversity. In the next stage, we will apply targeted visual enhancements such as color grading and particle refinement to reinforce conceptual coherence and immersive quality within the installation.

### Project Development

The following is a visual preview of our project's interaction logic:

It is important to note that this interaction logic represents an ideal framework. Minor adjustments may be made during the development process due to technical constraints or to accommodate user experience and behavioural responses better.
